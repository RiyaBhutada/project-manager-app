# Project Manager App

ðŸŽ¯ Goal <br/>
The Project Manager App is designed to help users organize their projects and tasks in one intuitive platform. It allows users to create projects with details like title, description, and due date, manage tasks within each project, and easily switch between projects using the sidebar. Additionally, users can remove tasks and delete projects as needed.
